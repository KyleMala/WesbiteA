  <div class="columnleft side" style="background-color:#ccc;"> Listen to Music: </div class="columnleft side">
	<p> Music is an essential part of my day. I listen to music in the car when I drive to and from school. 
		I listen to music when I do my homework. I also listen to music when I take showers! 
		Music is part of who I am and it can express a person's personality and emotions too!
	</p>
	<ul> This picture is the cover of Bruno Mars's album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans. This is my favorite album that Bruno Mars has made so far! </ul>
