  <div class="columnleft side" style="background-color:#ccc;">  <h2 style = "color: orange;" >  Listen to Music: </h2>
	<p> Music is an essential part of my day. I listen to music in the car when I drive to and from school. 
		I listen to music when I do my homework. I also listen to music when I take showers! 
		Music is part of who I am and it can express a person's personality and emotions too!
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> This picture is the cover of Bruno Mars's album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans. This is my favorite album that Bruno Mars has made so far! </li>
	</ul>

  <div class="columnleft side" style="background-color:#aaa;"> <h2 style = "color: green;" > Skate: </h2> 
	 <p> Whenever I am feeling stressed or I need some fresh air. I go outside and ride my skateboard.
	 I usually skate to my park or I just go around the neighborhood.
	</p>
	<ul> 
		<li> This is the skateboard that I am saving up to buy! It is made by SUPREME and it has zombies in the background that make the skateboard much better.</li>

  <div class="column middle" style="background-color:#bbb;"> <h2 style = "color: pink ;" > Paint: </h2> 
	  <p> Painting brings out the artistic and creative side of me. I like to listen to music while I paint so can become inspired to paint. 
		  I am in my happy place when I paint. I have no worries in my life and I am at peace.
